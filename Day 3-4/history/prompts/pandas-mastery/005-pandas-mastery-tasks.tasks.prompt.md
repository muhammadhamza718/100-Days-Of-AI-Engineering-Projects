## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for the Pandas Mastery Module with 35 specific tasks organized across 4 phases: Setup (T001-T003), Foundational (T004-T008), User Story 1 - Pandas Fundamentals (T009-T017), User Story 2 - Real Dataset Analysis (T018-T025), User Story 3 - COVID-19 Dashboard (T026-T034), and Polish phase (TXXX). Tasks follow proper format with checkboxes, IDs, parallel markers [P], and story labels [US1, US2, US3]. Organized to enable independent implementation and testing of each user story, with proper dependencies and execution order.
