# Pandas Mastery Module

This repository contains educational materials for learning Pandas, covering foundational structures (DataFrames, Series), intermediate data cleaning, and advanced aggregation techniques. This module includes three learning components:

## Components

1. **Pandas Fundamentals** - Core concepts including Series and DataFrame creation, indexing, and basic operations
2. **Real Dataset Analysis** - Practical application using real-world datasets like Titanic
3. **COVID-19 Dashboard** - Advanced time-series analysis and visualization

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or using uv:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

The learning modules are organized as Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory. Complete them in the following order:

1. `pandas_fundamentals.ipynb` - Start here to learn the basics
2. `real_dataset_analysis.ipynb` - Apply your knowledge to real data
3. `COVID19_Analysis.ipynb` - Complete the capstone project

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks (recommended but not required)
