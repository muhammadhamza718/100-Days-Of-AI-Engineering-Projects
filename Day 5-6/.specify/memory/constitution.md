# Project Constitution: Data Visualization Mastery

## Vision Statement
Implement a comprehensive data visualization curriculum featuring a Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) mini-project using Python with matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly libraries.

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Focus
Prioritize learning and demonstration of visualization techniques
<!-- Ensuring that all visualizations serve an educational purpose and clearly demonstrate key concepts -->

### II. Code Quality
Maintain clean, well-documented Python scripts
<!-- Following Python best practices, PEP 8 standards, and including comprehensive comments and documentation -->

### III. Reproducibility
Ensure all scripts run standalone with `uv run python <script_name>.py`
<!-- Making sure every script can be executed independently without external dependencies or setup -->

### IV. Visual Excellence
Every plot must include title, axis labels, and legend
<!-- Maintaining high-quality visualizations with proper labeling and professional appearance -->

### V. Dependency Management
Use uv package manager for all dependencies
<!-- Managing all project dependencies through uv for consistency and reproducibility -->

### VI. Technology Stack Compliance


Adhere to specified technology constraints: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, pandas, numpy, scipy

## Technical Standards
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Dependency Management**: uv package manager
- **Libraries**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, pandas, numpy, scipy
- **File Format**: Pure .py scripts (no .ipynb notebooks)
- **Plot Export**: Save key visualizations as PNG files

## Deliverables
1. `visualization_gallery.py`: Demonstrates capabilities of all three visualization libraries
2. `Titanic_EDA.py`: Comprehensive EDA with 15+ plots following 7-step methodology
3. `insights.md`: Documentation of top 5 findings from analysis

## Quality Requirements
- All plots must have descriptive titles, labeled axes, and legends where appropriate
- Minimum of 5 key plots exported as PNG files
- Code follows Python best practices and PEP 8 standards
- Scripts are modular and well-commented

## Constraints
- No Jupyter notebooks allowed (.ipynb files prohibited)
- All dependencies managed through uv
- Standalone executability requirement
- Adherence to 7-step Titanic EDA methodology

## Success Criteria
- All scripts execute without errors
- Visualizations meet quality requirements
- Deliverables produced as specified
- Educational objectives achieved

## Governance
This constitution governs all implementation decisions for the Data Visualization Mastery project.

All changes to the project approach must align with these principles and be documented appropriately.
